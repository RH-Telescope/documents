# Project Documents

Many organizations are unable to manage risk, provide governance, attest to the security of their technology, or account for zero trust at scale and pace.  Project Telescope to the rescue, and it is uniquely poised to enable these organizations to enhance their governance, risk, and compliance capabilities through a novel implementation of automation, visualization, and metadata consolidation - allowing customers to manage and mitigate cyber risk in real time.
