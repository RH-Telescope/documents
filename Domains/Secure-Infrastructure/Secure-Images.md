| Private image repositories can enforce image signing so only signed images are pushed and used in a given environment.  This can help reduce risk and ensure that only trusted and verified images are used aross the organisation. | All base images should be stored in a recognised, certified and protected image registry. | Within BigCorp Inc, we recommend Red Hat Quay for storing all base images. |
